Completed the redevelopment of a 10 year old SME website to take advantage of newer technologies and SEO optimizations.

Rebuilt the website with HTML5, CSS3 and responsive web design to provide a seamless and enhanced user experience across all device types. Additionally performed SEO optimizations to ensure higher visibility and relevance on Google and Bing.

Have continued to monitor and react to various metrics ([PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed), [Security Headers](https://securityheaders.com) and [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about)) to ensure peak web performance.
